# README

This is a simple photo gallery with authentication (Desvie).  I didn't not get too deep into Devise authentication. It can be improved. I have added Paperclip gem for uploading images.

* Ruby version
	Ruby on Rails version 5.1.6
	Ruby version 2.3.3
	
* System dependencies
	MySQL
	Bootstrap
	Devise
	Paperclip

* Configuration
	- Clone this repo
	- Run 'bundle install' to install dependent gems
	- Migrate database 'rails db:migrate'
	- Run web server
	- Go to http://localhost:3000/ to view.

* Database initialization
	You will need MySQL installed and configured to make this photo gallery to work.
	
Thank you.
